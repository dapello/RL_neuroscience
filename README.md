For a walk through, checkout out `RL_neuroscience.ipynb`.

the RL component of this repo were adapted (mostly lifted directly) from https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files, with models drawn from https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-ac and environments used from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.
